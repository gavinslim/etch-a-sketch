# The Odin Project: Etch-A-Sketch

Implementation of the Etch-A-Sketch project from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Goal: Create a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch

Requirements: 
1. Webpage with 16x16 grid of square divs
2. Set up "hover" effect so grid divs change color when mouse passes over, leaving a pixelated trail through your grid like a pen would
3. Add button on top of screen which will clear the current grid and send user popup asking for number of squares per side for the new grid
- New grid should be generated in the same total space as before so that user gets a new sketch pad. 
4. (Optional) Instead of changing the color of square from black to white, include a random RGB value
